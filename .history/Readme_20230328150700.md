# School Student Managemnet App

An application built to allow easy management and maintenance of student information within schools to improve the accessibility of student information for teachers as this is something I feel is lacking.

The project came from wanting to put my time studying Javascript into practice with no tutorial to follow.

## Technologies Used

1. JavaScript (arrays, OOP, DOM)
2. HTML
3. CSS

## How to use the Application

1. Student accounts are created through the "Add Student" sidebar modal.
2. Students can be searched for through the "Search Student" input in the sidebar.
3. You can then view the students current information and Schedule/Inbox through the corresponding buttons.
4. Messages are sent between current added users (messages can be sent to the same user, however, advised to send between different users).

## Application Core Functionality

1. The application's function revolves around OOP and the creation of a primary class. When new student data is inputted, a new instance of the class is created, and this instance gains access to all properties through prototypal inheritance. When this account is created it is immediately pushed into a student's array and stored locally (the same occurs for all pins).
2. I leaned heavily on the DOM to display student data dynamically by creating reusable elements and then storing DOM changes specific to a method inside of a function that could be called at multiple points.

3. When creating the inbox system, I wanted to reinforce my knowledge of array methods. I created two properties on the Student class (sent and inbox). I attached the currently logged-in account to a global 'currentAccount' variable and paired this alongside the filter method to check the receiver's account existed inside the Students array. If the filter method returned a value, the message was pushed into the corresponding property depending on the 'currentAccount'. To gain access to the object, I used the Spread operator to expand the result of the filter method into its elements and the 'this' keyword allowed me to target the specific property to push into.

## Lessons Learned

As one of my first projects I greatly enjoyed discovering problems and then understanding the solutions.

1.  Make a list of all features to implement prior to beginning development. This helped me to stay on track with developing only what I needed to do in that moment. After completing one feature I'd move onto another.
2.  The importance of clean HTML and completing this before entering production. I found myself having the make adjustments due to features.

         An example of HTML that initially was one continuous container. When it came to dynamically adding HTML I realized that when using "insertAdjacentHTML" on "Inbox Row" it would place the HTML code on top of eachother.

3.  When stuck, instead of struggling through, search for solutions on Stack Overflow and then understand the solution so that I can implement it within my project.
4.  Understanding scope and what is currently possible given my understanding of JavaScript.
5.  The importance of creating designs before beginning development. This allows for a smooth creation by following pre-established designs.
6.  The importance of the call stack and the order in which functions are called that perform DOM. I found myself in the early stages of development becoming confused as to why my function calls were not behaving as expected. This stretches to the order of declaring my JavaScript files inside my HTML.
7.  The key lesson I've taken away from this project is a much deeper understanding of how to achieve a dynamic webpage. After conducting initial research I discovered the ability to use media queries to adjust the display of how the webpage looks depending on the screen resolution. I focused my time on how the application looked on each screen resolution size, instead of taking into consideration how the application collapses. After completing the project I now understand how the properties of "Min/Max-Width", "Min/Max-Height" and "clamp" are the way to go when adjusting the size of containers. In the future, I would use media queries to change which elements are displayed.

## Current Features

1. Add/Search for specific students.
2. The ability to switch between light and dark mode.
3. Input a schedule for the student (WIP).
4. Inbox system for communication.
5. Error messages when creating an account/logging in.

## Future Features

1. Create an API database allowing for clean storage of information.
2. Using a database backend/library for the inbox system.
3. Refactoring CSS allowing for a dynamic application, adding properties such as "min/max-width" and "min/max-height".
